/**
 * A class for describing camera output, which contains a {@link Surface} and its specific
 * configuration for creating capture session.
 *
 * <p>There are several ways to instantiate, modify and use OutputConfigurations. The most common
 * and recommended usage patterns are summarized in the following list:</p>
 *<ul>
 * <li>Passing a {@link Surface} to the constructor and using the OutputConfiguration instance as
 * argument to {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations}. This is the most
 * frequent usage and clients should consider it first before other more complicated alternatives.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>Passing only a surface source class as an argument to the constructor. This is usually
 * followed by a call to create a capture session
 * (see {@link CameraDevice#createCaptureSessionByOutputConfigurations} and a {@link Surface} add
 * call {@link #addSurface} with a valid {@link Surface}. The sequence completes with
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession#finalizeOutputConfigurations}. This is the deferred usage case which
 * aims to enhance performance by allowing the resource-intensive capture session create call to
 * execute in parallel with any {@link Surface} initialization, such as waiting for a
 * {@link android.view.SurfaceView} to be ready as part of the UI initialization.</li>
 *
 * <li>The third and most complex usage pattern involves surface sharing. Once instantiated an
 * OutputConfiguration can be enabled for surface sharing via {@link #enableSurfaceSharing}. This
 * must be done before creating a new capture session and enables calls to
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession#updateOutputConfiguration}. An OutputConfiguration with enabled
 * surface sharing can be modified via {@link #addSurface} or {@link #removeSurface}. The updates
 * to this OutputConfiguration will only come into effect after
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession#updateOutputConfiguration} returns without throwing exceptions.
 * Such updates can be done as long as the session is active. Clients should always consider the
 * additional requirements and limitations placed on the output surfaces (for more details see
 * {@link #enableSurfaceSharing}, {@link #addSurface}, {@link #removeSurface},
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession#updateOutputConfiguration}). A trade-off exists between additional
 * complexity and flexibility. If exercised correctly surface sharing can switch between different
 * output surfaces without interrupting any ongoing repeating capture requests. This saves time and
 * can significantly improve the user experience.</li>
 *
 * <li>Surface sharing can be used in combination with deferred surfaces. The rules from both cases
 * are combined and clients must call {@link #enableSurfaceSharing} before creating a capture
 * session. Attach and/or remove output surfaces via  {@link #addSurface}/{@link #removeSurface} and
 * finalize the configuration using {@link CameraCaptureSession#finalizeOutputConfigurations}.
 * {@link CameraCaptureSession#updateOutputConfiguration} can be called after the configuration
 * finalize method returns without exceptions.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P Android P}, all formats except
 * {@link ImageFormat#JPEG} and {@link ImageFormat#RAW_PRIVATE} can be used for sharing, subject to
 * device support. On prior API levels, only {@link ImageFormat#PRIVATE} format may be used.</p>

     * buffer streams simultaneously. The {@link CameraDevice} may be able to share the buffers used
     * by all the surfaces from the same surface group, therefore may reduce the overall memory
     * footprint. The application should only set the same set ID for the streams that are not
     * simultaneously streaming. A negative ID indicates that this surface doesn't belong to any
     * surface group. The default value is {@value #SURFACE_GROUP_ID_NONE}.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, a video chat application that has an adaptive output resolution feature would
     * need two (or more) output resolutions, to switch resolutions without any output glitches.
     * However, at any given time, only one output is active to minimize outgoing network bandwidth
     * and encoding overhead.  To save memory, the application should set the video outputs to have
     * the same non-negative group ID, so that the camera device can share the same memory region
     * for the alternating outputs.</p>

     * <p>It is not an error to include output streams with the same group ID in the same capture
