### DEPRECATED: DO NOT EDIT ###

The source files for developer.android.com are NO LONGER MAINTAINED HERE, as
of 12/2016. Migration of content was completed on 10/16/2016.

All authoring of content has been moved to Piper (go/dac-source).

Exceptions and Caveats:

- Reference documentation is still maintained via building of .java source files,
  so you may continue to update JavaDoc comments to update documentation.

- Sample code documentation is not maintained in Piper, but is published from
  a separate code repository.
