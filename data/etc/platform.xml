    <!-- These are permissions that were mapped to gids but we need

         are not defined here while parsing packages.xml we would
         ignore these permissions being granted to apps and not
         propagate the granted state. From N we are storing the
         built-in permissions in packages.xml as the saved storage
         is negligible (one tag with the permission) compared to
         the fragility as one can remove a built-in permission which
