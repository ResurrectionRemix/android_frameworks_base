/**
 * This class provides a shared file to several threads. Only one thread
 * at a time can use the file. To acquire the file a thread has to
 * request it in a blocking call to {@link #acquireFile(OnReleaseRequestCallback)}.
 * The provided callback is optional and is used to notify the owning thread
 * when another one wants to acquire the file. In case a release is requested
 * the thread owning the file must release it as soon as possible. If no
 * callback is provided a thread that acquires the file must release it
 * as soon as possible, i.e. even if callback was provided the thread cannot
 * have the file for less time.
